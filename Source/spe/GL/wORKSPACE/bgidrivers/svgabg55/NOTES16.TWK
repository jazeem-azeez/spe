This is the latest version of my 16 color tweaked BGI driver.  All functions 
have been implemented (including floodfill), and should work like
the EGAVGA driver.

NOTES: Paging and mouse cursor will not work
       The mouse cursor will work if the HGXMOUSE TSR is loaded.

	o Mouse code hooks added (1.15)

	o Fixed text clipping at right and bottom edges (1.2)

	o Added compile-time support for 8x8, 8x14, or 8x16 bitmap fonts (1.2)

	o Drivers now have compile-time support for BGI version 3.0.
	  Supports protected mode with Borland Pascal 7.0 (1.5)

	o Integrated support for HGXMOUSE mouse cursor TSR. (1.65)
