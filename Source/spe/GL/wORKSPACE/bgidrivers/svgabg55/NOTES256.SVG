This is the newest version of my SuperVGA 256 BGI driver.  I have fixed 
several bugs in the previous releases, as well as added several improvements.

	o 1024x768x256 color mode is now supported on Tseng 4000,
	  Chips&Tech, Trident 8900 and Ahead video cards.

	o Getimage and putimage will work with bitmaps up to the 
	 size of available memory. (> 64k)

	o VESA support has been added.

	o Added setvgapalette256 function.

	o Floodfill is implemented. (still slow!) (2.0)

	o Added new logical operations to putimage (2.25)
	  XNOR_PUT
	  NOR_PUT
	  NAND_PUT
	  TRANS_COPY_PUT - Treats 0 as transparent (useful for cursors)

	o Logical operations for putimage actually work correctly! ;-> (2.3)

	o Fixed minor line drawing bug (2.31)

	o Support for the S3 card (non-native mode) has been added (2.4)

	o Paging has been implemented for SuperVGA cards that support it (2.4)
	  (Currently only support Tseng4000, C&T, Paradise and Video7;
	   ATI and Genoa cards do not support paging above 64k)

	Mode			Paging?		# of pages (with 1024k)
	320x200			yes 		16
	640x400			yes 		4
	640x480			yes 		3
	800x600			yes 		2

	    Acumos, Avance Logic 2101, Cirrus 54xx, Compaq, MXIC 68020, NCR, 
	    Primus 2000, Realtek

	o Paging enhanced to work with new cards (2.5)

	o Fixed text clipping at right and bottom edges (2.6)

	o Various speed optimizations (line & solid bar) (2.6)

	o Added compile-time support for 8x8, 8x14, or 8x16 bitmap fonts (2.6)

	o Drivers now have compile-time support for BGI version 3.0.
	  Supports protected mode with Borland Pascal 7.0 (3.0)

	o Fixed Cirrus Logic detect bug (3.05)

	o New, improved card detection support (3.1)
	  Supports IITAGX, UMC, HMC, Weitek cards.

	o Fixed Chips & Technologies detect bug (3.15)
