This is the newest version of my SuperVGA 32768 BGI driver.  All functions
have been implemented, but there may still be bugs.

Note:  Palette functions, and the mouse cursor will not work with this driver.
The mouse cursor will work if you have the HGXMOUSE TSR loaded.

  Using the HiColor driver:

	Implementing the 32768 color driver involved several hacks, as
	the BGI interface only supports 8-bit color values, but the driver
	needed support for 15-bit color values.  The procedures that needed
	to be changed were those that accepted color values, (SetColor,
	SetFillStyle, SetFillPattern, PutPixel and Floodfill)  and those 
	that return color values (GetColor and GetPixel).
	As the HiColor modes do not support palettes, I decided to use
	the SetRgbPalette call to set colors, as it accepts values for the 
	R,G and B components of the color.

	The format of a pixel in the HiColor modes is:
		-Byte 1- -Byte 0-
		xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB

	Several new functions are defined to make the color selection easier.
	In addition, the macro RGB(rv,gv,bv) has been defined.  It packs
	the R, G and B values into the format described above and returns the
	combined color.

	* RealDrawColor(); - Sets the current drawing color.
	  Usage:
	    setcolor(RealDrawColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)); - HiColor modes
	    setcolor(RealDrawColor(cval)); - (suggested for any other driver)

	* RealFillColor(); - Sets the current fill color.
	  Usage:
	    setfillstyle(fillstyle,RealFillColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    setfillstyle(fillstyle,RealFillColor(cval));
	    setfillpattern(fillpat,RealFillColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    setfillpattern(fillpat,RealFillColor(cval));

	* RealColor(); - For putpixel, sets the color of the pixel
		       - For floodfill, sets the color of the boundary
	    putpixel(x,y,RealColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    putpixel(x,y,RealColor(cval));
	    floodfill(x,y,RealColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    floodfill(x,y,RealColor(cval));

	* RealDrawColor, RealFillColor, and RealColor all use a hacked 
	  interface to setrgbpalette.  If you would rather use the call
	  directly, the format is:

	    RealDrawColor:
		setrgbpalette(1024,Rval,Gval,Bval); 
	    RealFillColor:
		setrgbpalette(1025,Rval,Gval,Bval);
	    RealColor:
		setrgbpalette(1026,Rval,Gval,Bval);

	  where Rval, Gval, Bval = 0..31.

	* GetPixel normally only returns an 8-bit value.  However, the
	  value returned from the BGI driver is a 16-bit value in DX (the 
	  BGI kernel loads the value into AX and clears the upper 8 bits),
	  so to read the value of a pixel:

	  In Pascal:
	    Color := getpixel(x,y);
	    inline($89/$56/<Color);  (* Loads 15-bit color value from DX*)

	  In C:
	    Color = getpixel(x,y);
	    Color = _DX;
	  

	* Support for the ATI XL card has been added (1.1) 
	    ATI only supports 640x480x32k

	* Paging has been added (1.1)

	  Mode		Paging?		# of pages (with 1024k)
	  320x200	yes		8
	  640x350	yes		2
	  640x400	yes		2
	  640x480	no		1
	  800x600	no		1

	o Mouse code hooks added (1.15)

	o New card support added, changed old card support (1.2)
	    Acumos, Avance Logic 2101, Cirrus 54xx, Compaq, MXIC 68020, NCR, 
	    Primus 2000, Realtek
	  Not all cards support 32k colors.

	o Paging enhanced to work with new cards (1.2)

	o Fixed text clipping at right and bottom edges (1.3)

	o Various speed optimizations (line & solid bar) (1.3)

	o Added compile-time support for 8x8, 8x14, or 8x16 bitmap fonts (1.3)

	o Drivers now have compile-time support for BGI version 3.0.
	  Supports protected mode with Borland Pascal 7.0 (1.5)

	o 1024x768x32k and 1280x1024x32k modes are now supported. (1.5)

	o Fixed Cirrus Logic detect bug (1.55)

	o New, improved card detection support (1.6)
	  Supports IITAGX, UMC, HMC, Weitek cards.

	o Fixed Chips & Technologies detect bug (1.65)

	o Integrated support for HGXMOUSE mouse cursor TSR. (1.65)

	o Fixed IIT AGX bankswitch bug (1.7)
